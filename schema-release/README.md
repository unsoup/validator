# Schema files extracted from `vnu.jar`Most of the files in this directory were extracted from thefollowing release of the v.Nu package `vnu.jar`:**16.3.3**downloaded from GitHub on:15 March 2016Exceptions:- This readme.- The license file in this directory and the license file in the `html5`directory. These license files are not distributed in the `.jar` from whichthese schemas have been extracted. They are copied from the correspondingdirectories in the v.Nu GitHub repo.Unlike the schemas in the v.Nu GitHub repo, the schemas in this directorymatch the schemas that are actually used by v.Nu (for example, by `vnu.jar`).## Matching Validator.nu presets to these RELAX NG schema filesThe [Validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) website presents a list of presets. Eachpreset identifies a particular language or combination of languages.Selecting a preset populates the **Schemas** field.URIs in the **Schemas** field that start with `http://s.validator.nu/` matchRELAX NG schema files in this repo directory:| Validator.nu preset | RELAX NG schema file|| :--- | :--- || XHTML + SVG 1.1 + MathML | `xhtml5.rnc` || XHTML + SVG 1.1 + MathML 3.0 + RDFa Lite 1.1 | `xhtml5-rdfalite.rnc` |
