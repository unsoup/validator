# This is a modified version of the following file from the Nu Html Checker:

#
# commit 0137f86 on 2015-06-28
# downloaded from GitHub on 2016-01-29.

# This modified version enables the v.Nu schemas to be accessed directly via GitHub;
# the modifications are necessary to refer to the directory structure of
# the source files in the v.Nu GitHub repository, rather than the structure
# of the distributed files.

# 2016-03-29  Inserted a comment header to match the v.Nu license
#             Added comments about modifications
#             Updated include directives to refer to v.Nu repo
